# About me

I am a PhD student at the University of Manchester as part of the Data Analytics and Society CDT programme. My research will focus on spatial data analysis and child labour.

# Projects

The following projects were completed as assessments for a Programming for Social Scientists module taught by the University of Leeds. Please click the project titles to learn more:

### [Sheep and wolves agent based model](https://tmcunningham.github.io/sheep-and-wolves)

This project simulates sheep moving around a field eating grass, while wolves hunt them. The code produces a GUI which the user can use to run an animation of the agent based model.

### [Planning for drunks](https://tmcunningham.github.io/planning-for-drunks)

WORK IN PROGRESS: This project is another agent based model, simulating drunks walking home from the pub. The drunks initially do not know which their house is and move randomly, but gradually sober up.
